# Indigo_Block_Hours_Model
This project analyzes flight On-Time Performance (OTP) for the DEL-BOM sector using synthetic data. It calculates block hour overrun, identifies key influencing factors like departure delays, weather, and ATC congestion, and builds a Logistic Regression model to predict on-time arrivals. Visualizations aid in understanding these impacts.
